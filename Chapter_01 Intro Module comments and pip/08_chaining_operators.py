# ✅ 2. Chaining Operators
# Python allows you to chain comparison operators to check multiple conditions in a clean way.
# 
# 🔹 Example:

x = 10
print(5 < x < 20)     # True → checks if x > 5 AND x < 20
print(1 == x < 100)   # False → 1 == x is False, so result is False


# ➡️ Equivalent to:

5 < x and x < 20
# ✅ You can chain: <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=
