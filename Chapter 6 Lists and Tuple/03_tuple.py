# In Python, a tuple is a data structure similar to a list but is immutable, meaning 
# its elements cannot be modified after it is created. Let's go over tuples, their methods, 
# and related functions.

a = (1,2,3,4)
print(type(a))    # tuple

a1 =()    # empty tuple
print(type(a1))     

a2 =(1)      # Int 
print(type(a2))     


a3 =(1,)      # singleton tuple
print(type(a3))     

m = (12,45,35,False , "baTMAN" , '17@' )
print(m[0])

# tuple is immutable 

# TUPLES IN PYTHON 
# A tuple is an immutable data type in python. 
a = () # empty tuple 
a = (1,) # tuple with only one element needs a comma 
a = (1,7,2) # tuple with more than one element
